Problem Statement

At Innomatics Research Labs, resume evaluation is currently manual, inconsistent, and 
time-consuming. Every week, the placement team across Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, and 
Delhi NCR receives 18–20 job requirements, with each posting attracting thousands of 
applications. 
Currently, recruiters and mentors manually review resumes, matching them against job 
descriptions (JD). This leads to: 
● Delays in shortlisting candidates. 
● Inconsistent judgments, as evaluators may interpret role requirements differently. 
● High workload for placement staff, reducing their ability to focus on interview prep and 
student guidance. 
With hiring companies expecting fast and high-quality shortlists, there is a pressing need for 
an automated system that can scale, be consistent, and provide actionable feedback to 
students.
